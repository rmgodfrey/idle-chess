# IDLE Chess

This Python program allows two people (at the same computer) to play chess on
the command line, or in an IDE like IDLE. Run the program *main.py* to play. For
the board to display properly, a monospaced font with glyphs for chess symbols
like &#x2654; (U+2654) and &#x265E; (U+265E) must be installed. One such font is
Deja Vu Sans Mono. The program works on Python 3.9, and should work on 3.8 as
well, though this has not been tested.

The program is not particularly functional, and was instead meant to be a
learning project for the creator. It was coded in 2020â€“2021. There is no
computer AI, and players cannot be on different computers.
