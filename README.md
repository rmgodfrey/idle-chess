# IDLE Chess

This Python program allows two people (at the same computer) to play chess on the command line,
or in an IDE like IDLE. Run the program *main.py* to play. For the board to display properly, a
monospaced font with glyphs for chess symbols like &#x2654; (U+2654) and &#x265E; (U+265E) must be installed.
One such font is Deja Vu Sans Mono. The program works on Python 3.9, and should work on 3.8 as well,
though this has not been tested.

The program is not particularly functional, and intended more as a learning project for the creator.
There is no computer AI, and players cannot be on different computers.
